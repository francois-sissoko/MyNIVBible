# MyNIVBible
Attempting to rebuild the Bible a few chapters at a time

Starting in Romans
1. Looking at the Main Bold Headings 
2. Looking at the links at the bottom of the page
3. Looking at the bold verse
4. Adding my favorite verse from each section 
5. Add Date and the Weather

#TODO add a few more chapters 
#TODO make the future chapters more dictionary based romans is list focused right now which doesn't interact with the links as well as 
it could. I feel like this feature will come together with time. But will require refactoring of Romans.py

Files
1. Romans.py
